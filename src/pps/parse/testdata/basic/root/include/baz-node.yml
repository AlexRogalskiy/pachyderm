pps:
  kind: node
  name: baz-node
service: bar
input:
  /in-bar: pfs://bar-repository
  /in-baz: pfs://baz-repository
  # baz-node uses an input that is an output of another node,
  # so baz-node will be deferred until that output is populated
  /in-bar-out: pfs://bar-repository-out
# baz-node has no output, which is fine
# you could also have no input, and the commands will just be run
