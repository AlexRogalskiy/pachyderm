pps:
  # kind is either service or node (job)
  kind: service
  # name must be unique across all services and nodes in the repository
  name: foo
# directives outside of pps will be specific to the kind
# in this case, we are matching docker-compose
# builds follow Dockerfile files, they are scoped to their context
