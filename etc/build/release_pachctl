# TODO:
# Releasing pachctl should do the following:
#
# 1) cross compile for all supported targets
# 2) clone pachyderm/homebrew-tap (and apt-get analogue)
#    a) update the formala / checksums / URLs
#    b) push the cross compiled binaries where they need to be to get valid URLs (probably a way to host these w github)
#    c) commit and push these changes (to homebrew-tap / etc)
