# Deploy Pachyderm on Amazon AWS

Pachyderm can run in a Kubernetes cluster deployed in AmazonÂ®
Web Services (AWS), whether it is an Elastic Container
Service (EKS) or a Kubernetes cluster deployed directly on
EC2 by using a deployment tool.

Installing Pachyderm on EKS is a 2 steps process:

1. **[Deploy a cluster on EKS](./deploy-eks/)**:
 
    If you already have an Amazon EKS cluster, you can quickly deploy Pachyderm on top of it. If you are just starting with Amazon EKS, this section guides you through the EKS deployment process.

    For a quick test installation of Pachyderm on AWS (suitable for development), jump to our [Quickstart page](../quickstart/).
