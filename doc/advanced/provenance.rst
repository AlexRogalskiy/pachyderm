Provenance
==========

Refer to Provenance Blog post

Understanding Where Your Data Came From
---------------------------------------

Explain provenance -- across commits / across repos



inspect repo --> shows provenance
inspect commit

list-repo -p data would return filter and Sum. 

commits looks weird -- call inspect commit and follow prov trail -- great for debugging for audit trail...
