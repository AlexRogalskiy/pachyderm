## ./pachctl rerun-pipeline

Rerun part of a pipeline.

### Synopsis


Rerun part of a pipeline.
Examples:

	# Rerun pipeline foo on commits from branch/n to branch/m
	pachctl rerun-pipeline foo branch/n -x branch/m

Arguments the commit arguments have similar meaning to those in list-commit,
you can use list-commit to see which output commits will be recomputed without
actually rerunning the pipeline.


```
./pachctl rerun-pipeline pipeline-name commit
```

### Options

```
  -x, --exclude value   exclude the ancestors of this commit, or exclude the commits on this branch (default [])
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --no-metrics   Don't report user metrics for this command
  -v, --verbose      Output verbose logs
```
