## ./pachctl start-commit

Start a new commit.

### Synopsis


Start a new commit with parent-commit as the parent, or start a commit on the given branch; if the branch does not exist, it will be created.

	Examples:

	# Start a new commit in repo "test"
	$ pachctl start-commit test

	# Start a new commit in repo "test", on a new branch "master"
	$ pachctl start-commit test -b master

	# Start a commit in repo "test" on an existing branch "master"
	$ pachctl start-commit test master

	# Start a commit with "master" as the parent in repo "test", on a new branch "patch"; essentially a fork.
	$ pachctl start-commit test master -b patch

	# Start a commit with XXX as the parent in repo "test"
	$ pachctl start-commit test XXX
	

```
./pachctl start-commit repo-name [parent-commit | branch]
