## ./pachctl deploy amazon

Deploy a Pachyderm cluster running on AWS.

### Synopsis


Deploy a Pachyderm cluster running on AWS. Arguments are:
  <S3 bucket>: An S3 bucket where Pachyderm will store PFS data.
  <id>, <secret>, <token>: Session token details, used for authorization. You can get these by running 'aws sts get-session-token'
  <region>: The aws region where pachyderm is being deployed (e.g. us-west-1)
  <EBS volume names>: A comma-separated list of EBS volumes, one per rethink shard (see --rethink-shards).
  <size of volumes>: Size of EBS volumes, in GB (assumed to all be the same).


```
./pachctl deploy amazon <S3 bucket> <id> <secret> <token> <region> <EBS volume names> <size of volumes (in GB)>
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --deploy-rethink-as-rc             Defunct flag (does nothing). The default behavior since Pachyderm 1.3.2 is to manage RethinkDB with a Kubernetes Replication Controller.
      --deploy-rethink-as-stateful-set   Deploy RethinkDB as a multi-node cluster controlled by kubernetes StatefulSet, instead of a single-node instance controlled by a Kubernetes Replication Controller. Note that both your local kubectl binary and the kubernetes server must be at least version 1.5.
      --dry-run                          Don't actually deploy pachyderm to Kubernetes, instead just print the manifest.
      --log-level string                 The level of log messages to print options are, from least to most verbose: "error", "info", "debug". (default "info")
      --no-metrics                       Don't report user metrics for this command
      --rethink-shards int               Number of RethinkDB shards (for pfs metadata storage) if --deploy-rethink-as-stateful-set is used. (default 1)
      --rethinkdb-cache-size string      Size of in-memory cache to use for Pachyderm's RethinkDB instance, e.g. "2G". Size is specified in bytes, with allowed SI suffixes (M, K, G, Mi, Ki, Gi, etc). (default "768M")
      --shards int                       Number of Pachd nodes (stateless Pachyderm API servers). (default 1)
  -v, --verbose                          Output verbose logs
```
