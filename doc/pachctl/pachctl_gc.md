## ./pachctl gc

Garbage collect unused data.

### Synopsis


Garbage collects unused data.

Currently, when a file/commit/repo is removed, the associated data is not
actually deleted from the underlying storage system (e.g. S3).  To remove
the data, you need to invoke GC manually.

Currently, GC is implemented such that it assumes no data is being added
or removed from the cluster.  Among other things, this implies that you
should only run GC when:

* No active jobs are running.
* No "put-file" or "delete-file" are ongoing.


```
./pachctl gc
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --no-metrics   Don't report user metrics for this command

```
