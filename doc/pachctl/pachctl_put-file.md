## ./pachctl put-file

Put a file into the filesystem.

### Synopsis


Put-file supports a number of ways to insert data into pfs:
	Put data from stdin as repo/commit/path:
	echo "data" | pachctl put-file repo commit path

	Put a file from the local filesystem as repo/commit/path:
	pachctl put-file repo commit path -f file

	Put a file from the local filesystem as repo/commit/file:
	pachctl put-file repo commit -f file

	Put the contents of a directory as repo/commit/path/dir/file:
	pachctl put-file -r repo commit path -f dir

	Put the contents of a directory as repo/commit/dir/file:
	pachctl put-file -r repo commit -f dir

	Put the data from a URL as repo/commit/path:
	pachctl put-file repo commit path -f http://host/path

	Put the data from a URL as repo/commit/path:
	pachctl put-file repo commit -f http://host/path

	Put several files or URLs that are listed in file.
	Files and URLs should be newline delimited.
	pachctl put-file repo commit -i file

	Put several files or URLs that are listed at URL.
	NOTE this URL can reference local files, so it could cause you to put sensitive
	files into your Pachyderm cluster.
	pachctl put-file repo commit -i http://host/path
	

```
./pachctl put-file repo-name commit-id path/to/file/in/pfs
```
