Getting Started
===============
If you've never used Pachyderm before, check out our :doc:`installation` instructions and :doc:`beginner_tutorial`. 


Already got a kubernetes cluster? Deploy Pachyderm in one line:

``$ kubectl create -f https://pachyderm.io/manifest.json``

(You'll still need to install :doc:`pachctl`)
