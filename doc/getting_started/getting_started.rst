Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the documentation portal for first time Pachyderm users! We've organized information into three major sections:

:doc:`local_installation`: Get Pachyderm deployed locally on OSX or Linux.

:doc:`beginner_tutorial`: Learn to use Pachdyerm through a quick and simple tutorial.

:doc:`troubleshooting`: Common getting started issues and how to fix them.


---


If you've already got a Kubernetes cluster running, you can deploy Pachyderm in one line:

``$ kubectl create -f https://pachyderm.io/manifest.json``

You'll still need to install ``pachctl`` so check out our :doc:`deploying_on_the_cloud` documentation.
