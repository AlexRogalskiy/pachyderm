# Deploying Pachyderm - Custom Object Stores

In other sections of this guide was have demonstrated how to deploy Pachyderm in a single cloud using that cloud object store offering.  However, Pachyderm can be backed by any object store, and you are not restricted to the object store service provided by the cloud in which you are deploying Pachyderm.

As long as you are running an object store that has an S3 compatible API, you can easily deploy Pachyderm in a way that will allow you to back Pachyderm by your object store of choice.  For example, we have seen Pachyderm be backed by [Minio](https://minio.io/), [GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/), [Ceph](http://ceph.com/), and more.  

To deploy Pachyderm with your choice of object store in Google, Azure, or AWS, see the below guides.  To deploy Pachyderm on premise with a custom object store, see the [on premiss docs](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/on_premises.html).
