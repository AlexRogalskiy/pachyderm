# OpenShift

[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is a popular enterprise Kubernetes distribution.  Pachyderm can run on OpenShift with two additional steps:

1. Make sure that privilege containers are allowed (they are not allowed by default). You can add `priviledged` scc (SecurityContextConstraints) to `pachyderm` service account:

```
oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_NAME>:pachyderm
```

or manually edit `oc edit scc privileged`:

```
users:
- system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_NAME>:pachyderm
```

2. Replace `hostPath` with `emptyDir` in your cluster manifest (Your manifest is generated by the `pachctl deploy ...` command or can be generated manually. To only generate the manifest, run `pachctl deploy ...` with the `--dry-run` flag).

```
      "spec": {
        "volumes": [
          {
            "name": "pach-disk",
            "emptyDir": {}
          }
        ],

 ... <snip>  ...

      "spec": {
        "volumes": [
          {
            "name": "etcd-storage",
            "emptyDir": {}
          }
        ],
```

Please note that `emptyDir` does not persit your data. You need to configure persistent volume or hostPath to persist your data.

3. Deploy Pachyderm manifest you modified.

```
$ oc create -f pachyderm.json
```

You can see the cluster status by using `oc get all` like kubernetes:

```
$ oc get all
NAME             DESIRED          CURRENT       AGE
rc/etcd          1                1             5m
rc/pachd         1                1             5m
NAME             CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE

po/pachd-foq68   1/1              Running       0                 5m
```
