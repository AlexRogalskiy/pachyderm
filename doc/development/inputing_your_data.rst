Getting Your Data into Pachyderm
================================

If you're running Pachyderm in the cloud, data in Pachyderm is backed an object store such as S3 or GCS. Files in Pachyderm are content-addressed as part of how we buid our version control semantics and are therefore not "human-readable." We recommend you give Pachyderm its own bucket.

There a bunch of different ways to get your data into Pachyderm.

`PFS Mount`_: This is the easiest method if you just have some local files (or dummy files) and you just want to test things out in Pachyderm.

`Pachctl CLI`_: This is the best option for real use cases and scripting the input process.

`Golang Client`_: Ideal for Golang users who want to script the file input process.

`Other Language Clients`_: Pachyderm uses a protobuf API which supports many other languages, we just haven't built full clients yet. 


PFS Mount
----------

To mount pfs locally use ``pachctl mount``. You can follow the first section of the :doc:`beginner_tutorial` or use the :doc:`pachctl` documentation.

Once you have pfs mounted, you can add files to Pachyderm via whatever method you prefer to manipulate a local file system:  ``mv``, ``cp``, ``>``, ``|``, etc.

Don't forget, you'll need create a repo in Pachyderm first with ``pachctl create-repo <repo_name>`` and add the files to ``~/pfs/<repo_name>``.


Pachctl CLI
-----------

The pachctl CLI is the primary method of interaction with Pachyderm. To get data into Pachyderm, you should use the ``put-file`` command. Below are a example uses of ``put-file``. Go to :doc:`pachctl/pachctl_put-file`` for complete documentation. 

.. note:: Commits in Pachyderm must be explicitly started and finished so ``put-file`` can only be called on an open commit (started, but not finished). The ``-c`` option allows you to start and finish the commit in addition to putting data as a one-line command. 


Add a single file:

.. code-block:: shell

 $ pachctl put-file <repo> <branch> -f <file>

Start and finish the commit while adding a file using ``-c``:

.. code-block:: shell

 $ pachctl put-file -c <repo> <branch> -f <file> 

Put data from a URL:

.. code-block:: shell

 $ pachctl put-file <repo> <branch> -f http://url_path

Add multiple files at once by using the ``-i`` option. The target file should be a list of files, paths, or URLs that you want to input all at once:

.. code-block:: shell

 $ pachctl put-file <repo> <branch> -i <file>

Pipe data from stdin into a file:

.. code-block:: shell

 $ echo "data" | pachctl put-file <repo> <branch> <path>

Add an entire directory by using the recursive flag, ``-r``:

.. code-block:: shell

 $ pachctl put-file -r <repo> <branch> -f <dir>



Golang Client
-------------

.. _autogenerated godocs: https://godoc.org/github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/src/client#APIClient.PutFile

For any Go users, we've built a Golang client so you can easily script Pachyderm commands. Check out the `autogenerated godocs`_ on ``put-file``. 

Other Language Clients
----------------------
.. _protocol buffer API: https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/master/src/client/pfs/pfs.proto

.. _other languages: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

Pachyderm uses a simple `protocol buffer API`_. Protobufs support a bunch of `other languages`_, any of which can be used to programatically use Pachyderm. We haven't built clients for them yet, but it's not too hard. It's an easy way to contribute to Pachyderm if you're looking to get involved.
