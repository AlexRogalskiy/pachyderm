Getting Started
===============


Already got a kubernetes cluster? Use it to create a pachyderm cluster:

``$ kubectl create -f https://pachyderm.io/manifest.json``

(You'll still need to install :doc:`pachctl`)

If you don't have a kubernetes cluster setup, check out our :doc:`installation` instructions.

If you've never used Pachyderm before you should look at the `Fruit Stand`_ example.
