Fruit Stand
-----------

This is our canonical starter demo. If you haven't used Pachyderm before, start here. We'll get you started running Pachyderm locally in just a few minutes and processing sample log lines.

Open CV
-------
Edge detection using OpenCV on whatever images you want. More interesting than the beginner tutorial, but still great for running locally in minikube and understanding intermediate-level Pachyderm topics.

Web Scraper
-----------

Using ``wget`` to build a distrbuted web scraper. Scraping is such a common task that we wanted to give you a simple example just in Shell.

Word Count
----------

Word count is basically the "hello world" of distributed computation. This example is great for benchmarking in distributed deployments on large swaths of text data.

Tensor Flow
-----------
Use Tensorflow to build a neural net that analyzes Game of Thrones scripts and produces new lines for characters. This is a great advanced example if you want to learn about the intricacies of Pachyderm and ML workflows -- and you get a really cool output!
